An analysis of how pop culture has influenced baby names in USA


Pop culture is something that binds us all and connects us all.

And therefore I thought to check how much has pop culture impacted a major component of demographic parameter- US baby names

This is a simple analysis based on a very helpful analysis done by Dhanush Kishore in https://www.kaggle.com/dhanushkishore/impact-of-game-of-thrones-on-us-baby-names

I have used most of the structure same as his, but have tried to look at a greater variety of TV shows, movies and artists(espectially those I am attached too)
